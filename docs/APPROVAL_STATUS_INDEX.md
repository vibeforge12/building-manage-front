## The Approval Status Flow at a Glance

```
User Login
    ↓
LoginResidentUseCase.execute()
    ↓
API Response with approvalStatus
    ↓
AuthStateNotifier.loginSuccess() - stores User with approvalStatus
    ↓
Check approvalStatus value:
    ├─ "REJECTED"    → Show error + redirect to /
    ├─ "PENDING"     → Show ResidentApprovalPendingScreen (3-sec timer) → dashboard
    └─ "APPROVED"    → Show ResidentApprovalPendingScreen (3-sec timer) → dashboard
```

## Three Approval States Explained

### PENDING (대기중 - Awaiting Admin Approval)
- User has logged in but not yet approved by building admin
- **Screen:** ResidentApprovalPendingScreen
- **Behavior:** Shows loading animation, auto-redirects after 3 seconds
- **Next Action:** Admin approves → State becomes APPROVED
- **Message:** "관리자\n승인 대기중" (Awaiting Admin Approval)

### APPROVED (승인완료 - Approval Completed)
- User has been approved by the building admin
- **Screen:** ResidentApprovalPendingScreen (currently - could use ResidentApprovalCompletedScreen)
- **Behavior:** Shows loading animation, auto-redirects after 3 seconds
- **Next Action:** Redirects to user dashboard
- **Message:** Same as PENDING

### REJECTED (거부됨 - Rejected)
- User's registration has been rejected by the building admin
- **Screen:** Home screen (login page) with error snackbar
- **Behavior:** Shows error message, clears form
- **Next Action:** User can try to reapply or contact admin
- **Message:** "가입이 거부되었습니다. 관리자에게 문의해주세요." (Registration denied. Contact administrator.)

## What to Know About the Current Implementation

### Implemented Features
- Approval status is checked immediately after login
- REJECTED users are prevented from accessing the app
- PENDING and APPROVED users see a waiting screen
- 3-second auto-redirect timer to dashboard
- Approval status stored in User entity throughout the session
- Complete debug logging for troubleshooting

### Areas for Enhancement
- APPROVED users could show a success screen (ResidentApprovalCompletedScreen)
- REJECTED users could show a detailed rejection screen with reason
- Could add polling mechanism to check for approval status updates
- Could add logout/retry options during approval waiting

## How Approval Status Flows Through the App

### 1. API Response
The login API includes `approvalStatus` field in the user object:
```json
{
  "user": {
    "id": "123",
    "name": "John Doe",
    "role": "resident",
    "approvalStatus": "PENDING"
  },
  "accessToken": "..."
}
```

### 2. User Entity
The approvalStatus is stored as a field in the User entity:
```dart
class User {
  final String? approvalStatus; // 'PENDING', 'APPROVED', or 'REJECTED'
}
```

### 3. Auth State
After login, the User is stored in the auth state notifier:
```dart
AuthStateNotifier._currentUser = User(...approvalStatus: 'PENDING'...)
```

### 4. Current User Provider
The approval status is accessible via currentUserProvider:
```dart
final user = ref.read(currentUserProvider);
final status = user?.approvalStatus; // Access anytime
```

### 5. Routing Decision
The status determines which screen is shown:
```dart
if (approvalStatus == 'REJECTED') {
  context.go('/');
} else {
  context.goNamed('residentApprovalPending');
}
```

## Debug Checklist

When troubleshooting approval status issues, check:

1. **API Response Check**
   - Is `approvalStatus` field present in login response?
   - Is it one of: 'PENDING', 'APPROVED', 'REJECTED'?
   - Check network logs with `API_DEBUG=true`

2. **User Entity Check**
   - Look for log: `🔍 User.fromJson - Raw JSON: ...`
   - Verify approvalStatus was parsed correctly

3. **Auth State Check**
   - Look for log: `🔑 LOGIN SUCCESS - userData: ...`
   - Check if `approvalStatus` is in the userData

4. **Routing Decision Check**
   - Look for log: `🔐 APPROVAL STATUS: ... `
   - Check if condition matched (REJECTED vs PENDING/APPROVED)
   - Verify correct screen shown

5. **Screen Behavior Check**
   - For PENDING/APPROVED: Look for `⏳ PENDING 화면 표시 완료...` in logs
   - Check if 3-second timer was triggered
   - Verify redirect to userDashboard occurred
